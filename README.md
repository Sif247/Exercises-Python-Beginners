[Exercise 4](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/Variables/Exercise%204.py)
Create a variable length and assign it a value. Then reassign the variable to 15. Print it to the screen.

[Exercise 5](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/Variables/Exercise%205.py)
Create a variable full_name and assign it a string containing your first and last name. Print it to the screen.

[Exercise 6](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/Variables/Exercise%206.py)
Create a variable future_age and assign it the value of the age you will have in 10 years (using the previously declared age variable). Print it to the screen.

[Exercise 7](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/Variables/Exercise%207.py)
Create variables first_name, last_name, and birth_year and assign them appropriate values. Print all of them in a single print statement. Then, overwrite all the variables and print them again in a second print statement.

[Exercise 8](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/Variables/Exercise%208.py)
Create a variable current_age and assign it the value of your current age by calculating it based on the current year. Print current_age to the screen.


## [String exercises](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/tree/main/String)

[Exercise 1](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/String/Exercise%201.py)
Assign the string "hello world" to a variable string. Use the upper() method to convert it to uppercase and store the result in a new variable.

[Exercise 2](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/String/Exercise%202.py)
Assign the string "Welcome to Rome" to a variable string. Use the lower() method to convert it to lowercase and store the result in a new variable.

[Exercise 3](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/String/Exercise%203.py)
Assign the string "The best is yet to come" to a variable string. Use the split() method to divide the string into a list of words.

[Exercise 4](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/String/Exercise%204.py)
Assign the string "Hello World" to a variable string. Use the replace() method to replace "World" with "Python".

[Exercise 5](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/String/Exercise%205.py)
Assign the string " Hello " to a variable string. Use the strip() method to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of the string.

[Exercise 6](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/String/Exercise%206.py)
Assign the string "abcdefg" to a variable string. Extract the first three characters of the string.

[Exercise 7](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/String/Exercise%207.py)
Assign the string "Python" to a variable string. Use the startswith() method to check if the string begins with "Py".

[Exercise 8](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/String/Exercise%208.py)
Assign the string "Hello world" to a variable string. Use the count() method to count how many times the letter "o" appears in the string.

[Exercise 9](https://github.com/Sif247/Exercises-Python-Beginners/blob/main/String/Exercise%209.py)
Assign the string "Hello world" to a variable string. Print the last 5 characters of the string in uppercase, replacing the letter "o" with "k".

## [Mathematical Operators exercises]()

[Exercise 1]()
Declare two variables, number1 and number2, and assign them two integer values. Perform the addition of the two variables and assign the result to a new variable sum, then print it to the screen.

[Exercise 2]()
Perform the subtraction of the two variables and assign the result to a new variable difference. Print it to the screen.

[Exercise 3]()
Perform the multiplication of the two variables and assign the result to a new variable product. Print it to the screen.

[Exercise 4]()
Perform the division of the two variables and assign the result to a new variable quotient. Print it to the screen.

[Exercise 5]()
Perform the modulo operation (remainder of the division) between the two variables and assign the result to a new variable remainder. Print it to the screen.

[Exercise 6]()
Increment number1 by 1 and decrement number2 by 3. Print the new values of both variables to the screen.

[Exercise 7]()
Multiply number1 by itself and add 5, then add it to number2 squared. Assign the result of this operation to a variable result and print it to the screen.

[Exercise 8]()
Find an operation to make number1 equal to 1 without directly reassigning it to 1. Subtract it from itself as part of the solution.
